\section{LLMs in Steganography: Approaches and Paradigms}
\label{sec:llm_approaches}

\subsection{Direct Generation via User Interfaces (Black-Box LLM-Stega)}
LLMs generate steganographic text directly via prompts, treating the model as a black box.

\subsection{Rewriting-Based Linguistic Steganography}
Secret messages are embedded by rewriting existing text using LLMs.

\subsection{Context-Aware Linguistic Steganography (NMT-Stega)}
Methods leverage LLMs' context awareness for more natural and secure embedding.

\subsection{Acrostic Linguistic Steganography}
LLMs generate text where specific positions encode information (e.g., acrostics).

\subsection{Collaborative/Hierarchical Linguistic Steganography}
Combines multiple LLMs or hierarchical strategies for improved capacity and imperceptibility.

\subsection{LLM-Based Watermarking (Related Work to Steganography)}
Watermarking uses LLMs to embed traceable patterns for provenance.

\subsubsection{DeepTextMark}
Deep learning-based watermarking for text.

\subsubsection{Principled Approach to Natural Language Watermarking}
Formal methods for robust, undetectable watermarking.

\subsubsection{ChatGPT for Stego Covers}
ChatGPT is used to generate steganographic covers.

\subsubsection{Paraphraser-based Lexical Substitution (Para-NLW)}
Paraphrasing with LLMs to encode information via lexical choices.
