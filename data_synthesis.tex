\section{Data Synthesis}

This section describes the process of synthesizing the extracted and classified data to answer the research questions. The synthesis involved aggregating findings, identifying common themes, and analyzing patterns across the primary studies.

\subsection{Presentation of Results}

The results of the data synthesis are presented in a structured manner, often utilizing tables, figures, and descriptive statistics to summarize key findings. This includes an overview of publication trends, distribution of studies across different categories, and the prevalence of various approaches and techniques.

\subsection{Discussion in Relation to Research Questions}

Each research question is addressed individually, with a detailed discussion of the synthesized data. This involves interpreting the findings, highlighting significant observations, and drawing conclusions based on the evidence gathered from the primary studies. The discussion also identifies areas where further research is needed and potential future directions.
