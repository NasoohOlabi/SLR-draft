\section{Key Challenges and Limitations}
\label{sec:challenges}

\subsection{Perceptual vs. Statistical Imperceptibility (Psic Effect)}
Improving perceptual quality can reduce statistical security, and vice versa.

\subsection{Low Embedding Capacity}
Short texts and strict semantics limit how much information can be hidden.

\subsection{Lack of Semantic Control and Contextual Consistency}
Ensuring generated text matches intended meaning/context is difficult.

\subsection{Challenges with LLMs in Steganography}
LLMs may introduce unpredictability, bias, or leak information.

\subsection{Segmentation Ambiguity}
Tokenization can cause ambiguity in how information is embedded or extracted.
