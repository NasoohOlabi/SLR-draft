\begin{abstract}
This study presents a systematic literature review on linguistic steganography, with a particular focus on the transformative impact of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the evolution of linguistic steganography within the Large Language Model (LLM) era. Our findings highlight that LLM-based approaches significantly enhance imperceptibility, embedding capacity, and naturalness in cover text generation, addressing long-standing challenges. The review underscores the shift towards more sophisticated, context-aware, and robust steganographic systems, paving the way for future research in secure and imperceptible covert communication. This study highlights the critical role of context and domain knowledge in advancing linguistic steganography, particularly in generative text steganography, where the goal is to achieve both perceptual and statistical imperceptibility. We observe how understanding the communicative context and leveraging domain-specific correlations between texts are crucial for overcoming limitations such as low embedding capacity and cognitive imperceptibility, ultimately leading to more secure and effective covert communication.
