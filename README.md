# Enhancing Contextual Compatibility of Textual Steganography Systems Based on Large Language Models

## Todo

- [ ] Correct Data Extraction Form (DEF) Content (Section 5.1): The current description of the DEF includes irrelevant "Requirements Engineering" (RE) fields. Revise Section 5.1 entirely to accurately describe data extraction fields and categories that are directly relevant to linguistic steganography research.

- [ ] Condense and Rephrase Abstract: The Abstract is highly repetitive. Condense it to a single, concise paragraph that clearly states the objective, methodology, key findings, and main conclusion without any repetition.

- [ ] Define All Critical Technical Terms: Provide clear, formal definitions for all crucial technical terms upon their first use (e.g., "Psic Effect," "perceptual imperceptibility," "statistical imperceptibility," "channel entropy requirements," "perfect samplers," "explicit data distributions," and "hallucinations").

- [ ] Substantiate All Strong Claims: For every strong assertion or claim (e.g., "significantly enhance," "best-known technique"), explicitly link it to the evidence derived from the reviewed papers or qualify the claim if direct quantitative proof is not provided within the review's scope.

- [ ] Eliminate Redundancy in Sections 2.4 and 8.2: Condense the elaboration in Section 2.4, avoiding re-statement of points already listed as challenges. In Section 8.2, consolidate the historical overview, ensuring each concept is explained once clearly and concisely, referencing previously defined terms instead of re-explaining them.

- [ ] Meticulously Proofread References: Correct all typographical errors in the reference list (e.g., change "leee Access" to "IEEE Access" for reference ). Ensure strict adherence to a chosen citation style (e.g., IEEE) throughout the entire reference list for accuracy and consistency.
