This section summarizes the main findings from the systematic literature review, focusing on the characteristics and performance of various LLM-based linguistic steganography and watermarking models.

\subsection{LLM-Based Steganography Models}

Our review identified several key LLM-based steganography models, each with unique approaches, strengths, and performance metrics. These models are discussed in terms of their underlying techniques, embedding capacities, and imperceptibility metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of the current landscape.
