## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to enhance the academic writing style and formality of the systematic literature review paper on LLM-based steganography.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Precision and Conciseness
- **Removed redundant phrases**: Eliminated unnecessary words and tightened sentences throughout
- **Replaced informal phrasing**: 
  - "Here are the research questions" → "The research questions addressed in this systematic literature review are"
  - "We used the following" → "The following search query string was employed"
  - "Our analysis reveals" → "The analysis reveals"
- **Strengthened verbs**: Used more active and authoritative language
- **Eliminated colloquialisms**: Removed casual expressions and made language more formal

### 2. Academic Tone and Objectivity
- **Reduced first-person pronouns**: Systematically replaced "we," "our," and "us" with passive voice or objective statements
  - "We focus on" → "The analysis focuses on"
  - "Our findings establish" → "The findings establish"
  - "We demonstrate" → "The research demonstrates"
- **Maintained neutral stance**: Ensured findings are presented based on evidence rather than personal interpretation
- **Consistent terminology**: Maintained consistent use of defined technical terms throughout

### 3. Flow, Cohesion, and Structure
- **Improved topic sentences**: Enhanced paragraph openings to provide clear roadmaps
- **Better transitions**: Added transitional phrases and improved connections between sections
  - Added context-setting sentences at the beginning of major subsections
  - Improved logical progression between research questions
- **Strengthened section introductions**: Each major section now has a clear introductory statement

### 4. Clarity and Readability
- **Simplified complex sentences**: Broke down overly complex sentences into clearer, more digestible parts
- **Enhanced technical definitions**: Maintained the strong terminology section while improving clarity
- **Improved examples**: Ensured all examples clearly support the points being made
- **Better paragraph structure**: Each paragraph now has a clear focus and logical flow

### 5. Grammar and Style Improvements
- **Fixed informal constructions**:
