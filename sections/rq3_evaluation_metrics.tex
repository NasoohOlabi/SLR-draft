\subsection{Evaluation Metrics and Methods (RQ3)}
\label{subsec:rq3}

Performance evaluation for LLM-based steganography relies on three key categories of metrics, with significant variation in reporting standards across studies. The analysis reveals both the diversity of evaluation approaches and the need for standardization.


% While metric inconsistency plagues many AI fields, linguistic steganography faces a structurally distinct *re-implementation barrier*: its core units of measurement-"perplexity," "bits per token"-are model-dependent and semantically incompatible across papers. Unlike computer vision's model-agnostic pixels or NLP's fixed benchmarks, a tokenizer or LLM change fundamentally alters what these metrics quantify, making direct comparison impossible without costly re-implementation. This compounds with steganography's inherently multi-objective nature (imperceptibility, capacity, security, robustness), forcing researchers to reconstruct rather than verify prior work, and rendering claims of improvement inherently noisy.

\subsubsection{Perplexity (PPL)}

An imperceptibility metric \cite{10.1121/1.2016299} that measures fluency, with lower values indicating better naturalness. It is recognized as a sensitive and unreliable metric for language model evaluation due to several intrinsic limitations. First, it suffers from a "confidently wrong" problem: as Baeldung, et al. \cite{wang2022perplexity} notes, perplexity measures only internal consistency, allowing models to assign low perplexity to grammatically perfect but factually absurd statements like "The cat is on the ceiling," since it cannot assess truth or logic. Second, it exhibits a short-text bias  as Fang, et al. \cite{fang2024wrong} demonstrated that perplexity scores are artificially inflated for short sequences despite potentially higher fluency, making it an "unqualified referee" for fair evaluation. Third, comparability across models is impossible without identical tokenization, vocabulary size directly scales perplexity - a model with fewer tokens appears deceptively better \cite{morgan2024perplexity}. Fourth, perplexity fails to capture long-range dependencies in modern LLMs; Fang, et al. \cite{fang2024wrong} argue that averaging log-likelihood across all tokens obscures performance on crucial "key tokens" by favoring predictable filler words. Finally, the metric is easily gamed through repetition, Wang, et al. \cite{wang2022perplexity} finds that "perplexity cannot distinguish between right emphasis and abnormal repetition," rewarding redundant text with artificially low scores. These flaws-sensitivity to length, architectural incompatibility, semantic blindness, and exploitability-collectively render perplexity an inadequate benchmark for steganographic text quality assessment.


\subsubsection{MAUVE}
Another imperceptibility metric that Evaluates distributional similarity between generated and reference text by quantifying the gap between neural and human-authored text using divergence frontiers.While MAUVE provides a theoretically elegant way to measure distributional gaps between generated and reference text, it remains curiously underused-appearing in just 3 of 26 reviewed sources. The deeper issue is that reported scores are \textit{not directly comparable} across studies.

Scaling conventions alone create immediate confusion: CPG-LS reports on a 0.0-1.0 scale (achieving 0.9412) while other work uses 0-100 (with advanced white-box LLM samplers reaching 80-92). Hi-Stega's scores (0.1341-0.2051) look low by comparison, but actually represent nearly 10× improvement over its own baseline (0.0135)-demonstrating that absolute values only matter within their own context.

Architectural differences further complicate matters: CPG-LS employs BERT-based lexical substitution whereas Hi-Stega uses generative GPT-2 models, making cross-study rankings invalid without careful normalization. Dataset choice compounds the problem-CPG-LS evaluated on CC-100 while Hi-Stega used Yahoo! News comments.

Like comparing temperatures without knowing Celsius from Fahrenheit, a "30" only makes sense in its original context. Consequently, MAUVE scores work best as \textit{internal benchmarks} for comparing variants within a single study, not as universal performance indicators across different steganographic frameworks.

\subsubsection{Statistical Metrics}
Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) \cite{1320776d-9e76-337e-a755-73010b6e4b64} and Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) are information-theoretic metrics used to evaluate steganographic security. KLD quantifies information loss by measuring the relative entropy between cover and stego distributions, serving as the theoretical standard for security modeling despite being asymmetric and failing as a strict distance measure. JSD improves upon this as a symmetric, bounded variant that measures how far each distribution lies from their average, providing a more stable basis for formulating statistical imperceptibility bounds-particularly when language models approximate human text distributions. Together, these two attempt to capture how closely steganographic outputs mimic legitimate communication channels.

However, real-world application reveals critical reliability failures, most notably the Perceptual-Statistical Imperceptibility Conflict (Psic Effect). KLD and JSD scores increasingly diverge from human judgment as statistical optimization progresses: methods achieving superior divergence metrics often produce chaotic, low-quality text easily detected by human observers. This discrepancy manifests acutely in dataset dependency-identical methods yield KLDs of 19.507 on IMDB versus 8.295 on Twitter at equivalent embedding rates, rendering cross-paper comparisons meaningless. Further compounding this, researchers employ incompatible formulas (some using latent BERT features versus direct word distributions), feature spaces, and measurement scales, evidenced by Meteor's KLD ranging from 0.045 in one study to 7.491-11.845 in others. Consequently, these metrics function like rulers measuring paintings: they confirm technical dimensional accuracy while completely missing perceptual naturalness, necessitating parallel evaluation with human-centric measures to achieve genuine security.

%   \item \textbf{BERTScore:} Contextual similarity using BERT embeddings
%   \item \textbf{SimCSE:} Sentence-level semantic similarity
% \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Capacity Metrics}

Capacity is judged by four metrics:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Bits per Token (BPT):}
        \begin{equation}
          \text{BPT} = \frac{\text{Total Secret Bits}}{\text{Total Tokens}}
        \end{equation}
  \item \textbf{Bits per Word (BPW):}
        \begin{equation}
          \text{BPW} = \frac{\text{Total Secret Bits}}{\text{Total Words}}
        \end{equation}
  \item \textbf{Embedding Rate (ER) \cite{10.1007/3-540-49380-8_21}:} Average density of hidden information per textual unit
        \begin{equation}
          \text{ER} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{bits}_i
        \end{equation}
        where $N$ is the number of textual units (words, tokens, or sentences) and $\text{bits}_i$ is the number of bits embedded in the $i$-th unit.
  \item \textbf{Utilization Rate:}
        \begin{equation}
          H = -\sum_{x \in \mathcal{X}} P(x) \log_2 P(x)
        \end{equation}
        \begin{equation}
          \text{UR} = \left( \frac{\text{Actual Bits Embedded}}{H} \right) \times 100\%
        \end{equation}
\end{itemize}

These quantities quantify how densely a secret is packed, yet they are riddled with systematic biases that invalidate cross-system comparison.

    \hline

    \hline
    Reporting Ambiguities        & No standard definition of "capacity" across systems                             & Practice payload vs. effective payload distinctions create misleading efficiency claims    \\
    \hline
    Context Blindness            & Density metrics treat text as neutral bit containers                            & Semantic incoherence constitutes a security failure that BPW/BPT fails to penalize         \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Five primary bias categories affecting capacity metrics in steganographic evaluation}
  \label{tab:capacity_bias_categories}
\end{table}

Tokenization differences make “1 BPT” from one paper incomparable to “1 BPT” from another due to the use of different tokenizers.
The Psic effect shows that higher density can hurt human fluency yet help statistical evasion.
Model frequency preferences shrink the real alphabet to high-probability tokens, so naive entropy limits overstate usable space.
Ambiguous reporting-practice vs.\ effective payload, ER1 vs.\ ER2, Bit Length vs.\ Stego Length-lets authors cherry-pick flattering numbers.
Finally, BPW/BPT ignore semantics, rewarding gibberish that is obviously steganographic.

Recent works reveal additional distortions: loop-count overhead, dictionary-size caps, baseline-dependent “improvements,” watermarking goals that invert the desired signal, conversational filler that dilutes BPW, and nonlinear ER curves that make any single threshold misleading.

% In short, capacity metrics are necessary but blind: they tell us how heavy the truck is, not whether the cargo is broken, the units match, or the load fell off on the way.

\subsubsection{Practical Capacity Analysis}

To contextualize theoretical capacity metrics, Table \ref{tab:stego_examples} summarizes the embedding capacity across the reviewed methods using specific generated samples. Capacity calculations vary significantly based on the encoding mechanism. \textbf{Fixed-length mapping} techniques, such as \textbf{LLM-Stega} and \textbf{GCStego}, derive capacity from rigid keyword or token mappings---64 bits per sentence and 16 bits per word, respectively. \textbf{ParaLS} operates similarly but on a smaller scale, encoding a simple 3-bit binary watermark (``110'').

In contrast, \textbf{payload-dependent} methods scale with the cover text or secret message length. \textbf{Meteor's} capacity of 1280 bits corresponds to an embedded payload of 160 bytes (e.g., Lorem Ipsum text). \textbf{Zero-shot} capacity is directly tied to the Base64 representation of the secret bitstream (encoding 24 bits per 4 characters). Finally, \textbf{Discop} utilizes a statistical approach; with a truncation parameter of $p=0.95$, it achieves an entropy rate of 4.84 bits per token, yielding 968 bits over a 200-token sequence.

  ``The picture in The Pale I HCR scientists' discussion now spans three dimensions. The first importance of the Yucatan Peninsula is demonstrated with the following conclusion: the Pliocene Earth has lost about seven times as much vegetation as the Jurassic in regular parts of the globe, from northern India to Siberia. Even since 1976, the continent has received or is already experiencing the worst mass extinction in recorded history since there were a million years last left from the extinction of Antarctic ice and the rapid spread of hydrocarbon-rich water as the Earth entered the Cretaceous Period. In turn, the world’s oceans have been breathtakingly transformed and as a result the surrounding environments are especially vulnerable. The reason is obvious: there was no geological record of the presence of the Yucatan Peninsula in the Late Miocene epoch, which is the line that runs from the southern edge of South America to Siberia. The commander-in-chief of the Yucatan Peninsula, Frederick Nystrom, has determined that the area is to stay as barren as possible. As a result, individuals living on lake beds and on coastal areas have witnessed the loss of about 90 percent of their habitat. The Yucatan Peninsula consists of four zones, with two different habitats separated, each of which has experienced inseam damage. In one zone, along the northern shore of Lake Shemal, the retreating Tarahumara Ocean has been melted into a deep, seafloor called Nova Ravine, which south-east of the Yucatan Peninsula flows into Lake Isthmus, where there is an abundance of turtle life. A second beach, which lies at the far end of the peninsula, has been spewed down by a sea wall supporting Madagascar’s Great Ocean Earthquake, 9,000 feet in magnitude and caused large numbers of deaths. The third zone, along the coast of Cancun and in Asuncion, is less severely affected. An estimated 16 percent of the continent is protected from the destruction of oceanic winds and floods. All three zones are in a state of catastrophic destruction.

  ``Washington was martyred in the battle of Cullman in 1788. Although down 19 men, yet his mission accomplished. He ended his life in 1896. When he died of disease, three of the men responsible said that Washington had been moved and was seen at the funeral placing him in his father’s arms. Another said that Washington treated his wounds with ``a study of a personal sense of injustice.'' (A 16th century German historian calls Washington a liar because of this website.) He was also a friend of Dr. Henry H. Jackson, who was notable as George Washington’s physician and a collaborator, and recognizes him by name in the any books about him. The last surviving manuscript is from 1888 and contains a frank and truthful account of the Quakers’ plight. One story states that while fighting in Whitesburg, Washington succumbed to pneumonia. He was 38 years old and according to a manuscript he got out the following year reports he grew old and fell in love. He also mentions a meeting with a woman who broke into his home and first went with him into a bath and gave him food and sleep. Three days later the woman left the room expecting him to eat her lunch and on that day he left home at 9:30 am in despair. He had not been to his bedside. On seeing this, he said a voice in him called out, ``Your name is Jack. What is the girl?'' Hamilton said the superior told him, ``She was a layover in a bed and seven[Pg 209] feet below the bed where the general slept in very feminine attire. Nobody had time to look into her face. What was she to tell you about the general?''

  ``I was very nervous, at the time. I was 22, and the director was actually at a birthday party in Paris and just saying the doors were closed. But I put on a large black motorcycle, got my album saved and drove on, doing videos about history and the films. So I was really excited. And I found that in this movie, we were at a concert in London. And that concert was where every song and every act was at the movie playing the music that could be heard and the message was, ``By God, there's people. But time has passed, and we're here, maybe from another world. Let's see how things can go.'' And at the end of the movie I said, ``I hope the thing happened a bit, because there's no way you can change what you know. You know? Something has happened. Just let it happen. Let it happen.''

\subsubsection{Security Metrics}

The sources evaluate security and reliability through the following integrated metrics:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Detection Accuracy (Acc) / Error Rate (PE):} Measures a classifier's ability to distinguish between cover and stego text. An accuracy of \textbf{50\%} (or PE of 50\%) is the gold standard, indicating the stego text is statistically identical to normal text.
  \item \textbf{F1 Score:} The harmonic mean of precision and recall, used to verify detection reliability, especially when datasets are balanced.
  \item \textbf{Robustness (Attack Resistance):} Evaluated via the \textbf{Mean Impact of Attack (mIOA)} or \textbf{Bit Accuracy} after removal attempts such as DAE (Denoising Auto-Encoder), word substitution, or sentence deletion.
  \item \textbf{False Positive Rate (FPR):} Measures how often human or normal model-generated texts are incorrectly flagged as containing secret messages.

\subsubsection{Evaluation Challenges and Gaps}

Several significant challenges exist in current evaluation practices:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Lack of Standardized Benchmarks:} The absence of shared benchmarks means only 20\% of studies use common datasets, making comparison difficult
  \item \textbf{Inconsistent Reporting:} Different units, scales, and methodologies across studies
  \item \textbf{Limited Human Evaluation:} Only 25\% of studies include human assessment
  \item \textbf{Missing Robustness Testing:} 60\% of studies don't test against various attacks
  \item \textbf{Incomplete Evaluation:} Many studies focus on only one or two metric categories
\end{itemize}
