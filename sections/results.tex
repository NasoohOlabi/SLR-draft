\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

This section presents the synthesized findings from our systematic literature review of 26 primary studies (6 pending acquisition) on LLM-based steganography. The results are organized around five research questions to provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state, applications, evaluation methods, knowledge integration, and limitations in this rapidly evolving field.
