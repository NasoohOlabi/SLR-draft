\subsubsection{Covert Communication Applications}

Covert communication represents the primary application domain, with approximately 60\% of papers focusing on this use case. Key characteristics include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Censored Environments:} Particularly important for use in environments with restricted communication
  \item \textbf{High Imperceptibility Requirements:} Need for both perceptual and statistical imperceptibility
  \item \textbf{Context Awareness:} Many systems leverage contextual information to enhance naturalness
  \item \textbf{Real-time Deployment:} Emphasis on practical, deployable solutions
\end{itemize}

Notable examples include \textbf{Co-Stega}, which expands text space through context retrieval and entropy enhancement for social media applications, and \textbf{FreStega}, which provides a plug-and-play approach to imperceptibility.

\subsubsection{Watermarking and Fingerprinting Applications}

About 30\% of studies focus on watermarking and fingerprinting applications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Content Tracing:} Watermarking for tracking content origin and ownership
  \item \textbf{Model Fingerprinting:} Identifying and licensing LLMs for commercial use
  \item \textbf{Copyright Protection:} Embedding ownership information in generated content
  \item \textbf{Attribution:} Ensuring proper credit for content creators
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Emerging Applications}

Recent studies demonstrate novel applications that expand the traditional scope:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Social Media Hiding:} Models such as \textbf{Co-Stega} expand text space through context retrieval and entropy enhancement
  \item \textbf{Jailbreak Attacks:} Steganography can conceal harmful queries, as demonstrated in \textbf{StegoAttack}
  \item \textbf{Data Exfiltration:} \textbf{TrojanStego} embeds secrets directly into LLM outputs
  \item \textbf{Multimodal Steganography:} Integration with vision-language models for text-image combinations
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Domain-Specific Applications}

The field further investigates domain-specific applications, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{High-Entropy Texts:} Utilization in news articles and formal documents
  \item \textbf{Short Prompts:} Question-and-answer paradigms for conversational AI
  \item \textbf{Specialized Corpora:} Medical, legal, and technical document steganography
  \item \textbf{Cultural Contexts:} Adaptation to different cultural and linguistic contexts
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Application Requirements and Constraints}

Different applications impose varying requirements on steganographic systems:

    \hline
    Fingerprinting       & Low (0.5-2 bpt)               & Medium                  & Medium                    \\
    \hline
    Social Media         & High (3-5 bpt)                & High                    & Very High                 \\
    \hline
