\section{Background and Evolution of Linguistic Steganography}
\label{sec:background}

This section summarizes key concepts and the evolution of linguistic steganography.

\subsection{Imperceptibility in Steganography}
Imperceptibility means making steganographic text indistinguishable from normal text, measured by perceptual, statistical, and semantic criteria. Improving one aspect can harm another (Psic Effect).

\subsection{Security Definitions and Metrics}
Security is measured by information-theoretic metrics (e.g., KL divergence) and computational indistinguishability.

\subsection{Evolution of Linguistic Steganography}
Early methods used syntax/statistics but lacked naturalness. Neural models improved fluency but sometimes compromised security.

\subsection{Provably Secure Steganography in Practice}
Classical secure methods include rejection sampling and arithmetic coding.
