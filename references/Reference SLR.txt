Abstract
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to support the automation of different Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks. Most of the proposed approaches start with various NLP steps that
analyze requirements statements, extract their linguistic information, and convert them to easy-toprocess representations, such as lists of features or embedding-based vector representations. These
NLP-based representations are usually used at a later stage as inputs for machine learning techniques or rule-based methods. Thus, requirements representations play a major role in determining
the accuracy of different approaches. In this paper, we conducted a survey in the form of a systematic literature mapping (classification) to find out (1) what are the representations used in RE tasks
literature, (2) what is the main focus of these works, (3) what are the main research directions in
this domain, and (4) what are the gaps and potential future directions. After compiling an initial
pool of 2,227 papers, and applying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, we obtained a final pool
containing 104 relevant papers. Our survey shows that the research direction has changed from
the use of lexical and syntactic features to the use of advanced embedding techniques, especially
in the last two years. Using advanced embedding representations has proved its effectiveness in
most RE tasks (such as requirement analysis, extracting requirements from reviews and forums,
and semantic-level quality tasks). However, representations that are based on lexical and syntactic
features are still more appropriate for other RE tasks (such as modeling and syntax-level quality
tasks) since they provide the required information for the rules and regular expressions used when
handling these tasks. In addition, we identify four gaps in the existing literature, why they matter,
and how future research can begin to address them.

1. Introduction
Requirements Engineering (RE) is the most critical phase of the software development life cycle
[1]. It aims to specify precisely the requirements that must be met or possessed by the desired system
[2]. RE involves a wide range of tasks related to extracting, documenting, analyzing, validating,
and managing requirements [3]. The requirement represents the core elements of all these tasks. It
is a broad concept describing a purpose, a need, a goal, a functionality, a constraint, a quality, a
behavior, a service, a condition, or a capability [4]. Requirements play a major role in the success
or failure of software projects [5]. According to many studies, most errors in software development
projects stem from the RE phase. The lack of understanding of requirements increases the risk of
time and cost overrun of the project [5, 3].
Requirements come from various stakeholders who have different needs, roles, and responsibilities, and are as such prone to the occurrence of conflicts including interference, interdependency,
and inconsistency [6]. Moreover, requirements typically are specified in natural languages, which
increases the complexity of requirement engineering because of the inherent ambiguity, incompleteness, and inaccuracy of natural languages [7]. These factors make RE tasks challenging, timeconsuming, and error-prone work mainly for large projects, as large volumes of requirements need
to be processed, analyzed, and understood [8].
Many researches have been carried out on the automation of different RE tasks. The proposed
approaches usually start by applying a set of Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps that extract linguistic features and information from requirements texts and construct various NLP-based
representations. These representations are used in further stages to solve the targeted task (e.g.,
classifying requirements [9, 10, 11], detecting trace links, discovering quality defects, etc.).
In the last decade, a growing number of works employed various syntactic and semantic-based
features to represent requirements. The used representation is considered one of the most important
factors that affect the accuracy of the proposed solutions for different RE tasks [12, 13]. Therefore,
there is a need to analyze the related literature to investigate the suggested representations, identify
gaps, and guide future research.
To address the aforementioned needs, a systematic mapping review was used as a research
method for this study. A mapping review is aimed at providing an understanding of the scope
of the research activities in a given area [14]. Compared to a traditional literature review, a
mapping review has many advantages, such as a well-defined methodology that reduces bias and a
wider context that allows more general conclusions [15]. The review presented in this paper aims
to identify all recently published primary literature that employs NLP-based representations to
support RE tasks. We classify these works based on two aspects: the targeted RE task and the
proposed representation, and identify potentials and gaps in the field to inform future research.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In section 2 we provide a background for NLPrelated concepts. Section 3 provides a quick overview of related works. Section 4 describes the
methodology adopted to conduct this study including the search terms, online databases, and the
2
systematic mapping process. Section 5 presents and discusses our results. We summarize our
findings in section 6 and conclude our paper in section 7.
2. Background: Natural Language Processing
Natural language processing is one of the main artificial intelligence disciplines. It aims to enable
computer programs to “understand” and process natural language texts to achieve some specific
goals [16, 17]. Traditionally, there are three main levels of processing in an NLP-based approach:
[18]: lexical and morphological level, syntactic level, and semantic level.
2.1. Morphological (or Lexical) Level
The Morphological level focuses on analyzing words into their morphemes like prefixes, suffixes,
and base words. It includes common tasks, such as Tokenization and Lemmatization [18].
Tokenization: the process of splitting a text into a list of tokens. Tokens can be words,
numbers, or punctuation marks.
Lemmatization: the process of finding the dictionary form, or the lemma, of each word. For
example, the lemma of “Supporting” and “Supported” is “Support”.
2.2. Syntactic Level
The Syntactic level focuses on analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences. This level usually includes Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS-tagging), Chunking, dependency Parsing, and NamedEntity Recognition [18].
POS-Tagging: the process of tagging each token in a sentence with its corresponding part of
a speech tag (such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.) based on its syntactical context [19].
Chunking: the process of detecting syntactic constituents such as Noun Phrases and Verb
Phrases in a sentence [20].
Dependency Parsing: the process of analyzing the syntactic structure of the sentence, by
finding out the grammatically related words, as well as the type of the relationship between them
[21].
Named-Entity Recognition: It seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in the
sentence into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, etc [22].
2.3. Semantic Level
The Semantic level focuses on understanding the meaning of the text. The main goal of semantic
processing is to automatically map a natural language sentence into a formal representation of its
meaning. Different semantic representations have been proposed in the literature, such as:
3
Ontology-Based Representation: The ontology is a data model that represents a set of
concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts [23]. WordNet [24] is one
of the widely used lexical ontologies. Ontologies are commonly used to assign words to a predefined
set of concepts and to measure semantic similarity between them using different ontology-based
measures such as Wu and Palmer [25] and path-based similarity [26].
Vector Space Model (VSM): A basic representation model that represents text as a termby-document matrix [27]. The Bag-of-Words (BOW) model is a special case for VSM where words
frequencies are used as weights, and words are used as features. Other weighting factors are used
in VSM, such as IDF and TF-IDF.
Topic Modeling-Based Representation: A statistical modeling approach used to discover
the latent or abstract topics that occur in a set of texts. These topics are used to represent each
text. This approach helps in finding a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix by
retaining the semantic relations between words. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [28] and Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA) [29] are two common examples of this approach.
Advanced Embedding Techniques: Embedding is an efficient method for learning highquality vector representations of words from large amounts of unstructured text data [30]. Word
embedding can capture the context of a word within a document, which allows words with similar
meanings to have similar vector representations. Many famous pre-trained word embeddings are
available to the public, such as Word2Vec [30], GloVe [31], BERT [32], etc.
3. Related Reviews
Many reviews have been published on the relation between NLP and RE tasks [33, 34, 35].
Some of these reviews provide a broad picture of NLP activities and technologies used in the
RE domain [36, 37, 33]. Dermeval et al. [36] conducted a systematic literature review to identify
the primary studies on the use of ontologies in the RE domain. This study considered 77 studies
published between January 2007 and October 2013. Nazir et al. [37] investigated the applications
of NLP in the context of RE. It included 27 studies published between 2002 and 2016. Zhao et al.
[33] introduced a comprehensive overview of the applications of NLP in RE research focusing on the
state of the literature, the state of empirical research, the research focus, the state of the practice,
and the NLP technologies used. This study reviewed 404 relevant primary studies reported between
1983 and April 2019.
Other reviews focused on specific RE problems. Bozyigit et al. [38] provided a review of 44
primary studies related to the automatic transformation of software requirements into conceptual
models. It covered works published between 1996 and 2020.
On the other hand, a number of reviews have limited their work to specific templates for requirements [35, 34]. Amna et al. [35] reviewed studies that investigate or develop solutions for

problems related to ambiguity in user stories. The study covered 36 researches published between
2001 and 2020. Similarly, Raharjana et al. [34] presented a systematic literature review for research
related to the role of NLP on user story specification. This work found 30 primary studies between
January 2009 to December 2020.
Although all these works provided good information regarding requirements engineering, no
conducted secondary studies have focused on the used techniques to represent textual requirements
and the involved syntactic and semantic aspects in these representations.
4. Research Method
This study was undertaken as a systematic mapping review using the guidelines presented in
Petersen et al. [15]. The goal of this review is to identify, categorize, and analyze existing literature
published between 2010 and 2021 and use syntactic and semantics aspects to represent software
requirements when handling RE tasks.
4.1. Planning
In this section, we define our research questions, the search strategy we use, and the inclusion
and exclusion criteria considered to filter the results.
4.1.1. Research question
Our work is guided by the following main research questions:
“How are the syntactic and semantics aspects considered to represent software requirements when
handling RE tasks?”.
This question is detailed in the following five RQs:
(RQ1) What is the state of the published literature on RE works that use syntactic and semantic
representations for requirements?
5
(RQ2) In which RE tasks are the syntactic and semantic aspects mostly considered to represent
requirements?
(RQ3) What are the proposed representations in the literature for RE tasks?
(RQ4) What are the main research directions to represent requirements for each category of RE
tasks?
(RQ5) What gaps and potential future directions exist in this field?
While the first question (RQ1) focuses on having a general overview of the published works
(number of publications and the top publication venues), the second and the third questions analyze
the targeted problems in RE (RQ2) and the proposed solutions (RQ3). The fourth research question
(RQ4) explores the current research directions for each category of RE tasks, and the fifth question
(RQ5) discusses the gaps and possible future improvements in this domain.
4.1.2. Search Strategies
We used five digital libraries to conduct the automated search: Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM
Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink. Scopus and ScienceDirect are general indexing
systems that help to cover a broader scope for our search. On the other hand, IEEE Xplore, ACM
Digital Library, and SpringerLink publish papers related to the most well-known conferences and
journals related to the software domain.
The search string is built based on the following three key terms: “Requirements Engineering”,
“Syntactic Processing”, and “Semantic Processing”. These terms are derived from our main research question. Each of these terms is enriched by adding synonyms and sub-fields. Table 1 shows
the whole set of selected keywords for this study divided into three groups: A, B, and C. These
groups were used to create the final search query as follows:
A AND ( B OR C)
4.1.3. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are used to filter out papers that are not relevant to our research
questions. We defined three inclusion criteria and four exclusion criteria.
Inclusion Criteria:
1C1: Peer-reviewed research presents an approach related to the field of software requirements
engineering.
2C2: The research uses NLP techniques including syntactic or semantic processing.
3C3: It is published between 2010 and 2021
Exclusion Criteria:
EC1: Secondary research is excluded (such as literature reviews, summaries, etc.)
EC2: The research is published in languages other than English

Figure 1: Search flow diagram for our systematic review
EC3: Duplicate papers (only the most recent and detailed one is considered)
EC4: The study does not provide detailed information about the proposed approach (such as, short
papers, posters, etc.)
4.2. Conducting the Search
The review process consists of five main stages. Figure 1 illustrates these stages and the numbers
of selected publications after each stage. Starting from the defined data sources, we obtained a total
of 2,227 candidate papers. Duplicated papers were automatically eliminated using Parsifal tool1
first, and then additional duplicate entries were manually eliminated by comparing authors, titles,
and abstracts. After removing all duplicates, 1,573 papers remained.
These papers are filtered by applying the selection criteria based on titles and abstracts. This
stage led to the selection of 252 papers. A full-text review of those papers was then conducted to
discard papers that did not satisfy our selection criteria. The remaining primary research papers
after this stage are 98. Finally, reference checking led to an additional 6 relevant papers. After
these stages, our final list consists of 104 unique primary papers.

4.3. Data Extraction and classification
A Data Extraction Form (DEF) is developed to collect the required data to answer our RQs.
The form is designed in a table format consisting of the following types of information:
• Bibliometric Information: author(s), publication year, type of publication, and publication
venue.
• Targeted RE task(s).
• Proposed solution including the Syntactic and semantic information used to represent requirements.
• Evaluation Details: evaluation dataset, used metrics, and the results.
• limitations and constraints.
5. Results and Discussions
This section describes and explains the results obtained by the analysis of the 104 selected
papers answering the RQs exposed in the previous sections.
5.1. (RQ1) What is the state of the published literature on RE works that use syntactic and semantic
representations for requirements?
As previously mentioned, our final list consists of 104 unique peer-reviewed research papers. Fig
2 shows the distribution of these publications per year. This chart reflects a growing interest in the
use of syntactic and semantic levels of processing to handle RE tasks. The vast majority of papers
(more than 85%) have been published since 2015.
Among the selected papers, 47% of them appeared in journals; 42% of papers were published
in conference proceedings, while 11% of papers came from workshops.
The most popular venue for publishing articles related to our study is IEEE International
Conference on Requirements Engineering and its workshops with more than 12% of papers, while the
most popular journals are: Information and Software Technology, Empirical Software Engineering,
Requirements Engineering with 5-6% of papers in each of them.
5.2. (RQ2) In which RE tasks are the syntactic and semantic aspects mostly considered to represent
requirements?
We classified the retrieved papers based on the type of the targeted RE task. Fig. 3 shows the
hierarchy of all 104 papers categorized into 6 top-level categories and 19 subcategories. The six
main categories are:

5.2.1. Requirements Analysis
This category represents the majority of publications (50 out of 104 papers). It includes papers
focusing on the following RE tasks:
• Requirements Classification: Requirements classification is an important step towards
automatically analyzing natural language requirements, especially when handling projects
with large numbers of requirements [10]. We recognized 21 papers proposing solutions to
various requirements classification tasks. Most of them focused on Functional/Non-Functional
classification tasks [39, 40, 41, 10, 11, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49], while the remaining focused
on other classification tasks: security/Not security [50, 51, 52], topic-based classification [53],
and classification based on requirements importance level [54].
• Requirements Traceability: Requirements traceability is used to capture the relationships
between the requirements, the design, and the implementation of a system [55]. We recognized
21 papers related to this task, part of which focused on detecting the relationships between
requirements (inter-dependency between requirements) [56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65,
66], while the remaining focused on detecting the relationships between requirements and
other artifacts (design documents and source code) [67, 55, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74].
• Requirements Clustering: Requirements clustering is used to organize software requirements into a set of clusters with high cohesion and low coupling [75]. We recognized 5 papers
presenting approaches to cluster requirements. These papers used the resultant clusters to
understand the main functional groups or topics over requirements [76, 77, 78], to organize
9

10
requirements in a tree structure (hierarchy) [79], or as a step towards discovering redundancy
and inconsistency between requirements [80].
• Semantic Role Labeling: Semantic role labeling is the task of extracting semantic information from a software requirements specification [81]. Four papers addressed this task
[82, 83, 81]. These works focused on mapping requirements to formal representations by
extracting their main semantic elements such as actors, actions, and objects.
5.2.2. Requirements Extraction
Requirements extraction (or elicitation) is one of the crucial steps in software development. We
recognized 19 papers addressing tasks related to this category. These papers can be divided into
three groups:
• Extracting Requirements from Reviews and Forums: 9 papers [84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 63,
89, 90, 91] proposed solutions for this task, where various applications reviews and forums are
used as a source for input texts such as App Store and Google Play.
• Extracting Requirements from Textual Documents: 7 papers [92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98]
presented approaches to extract requirements from SRS documents, policies, user manuals,
and emails.
• Extracting Requirements from Similar applications: 3 papers [99, 100, 101] focused
on recommending requirements based on the specifications of similar applications. This goal
is achieved by processing the description of similar products to suggest new possible features
and generate creative requirements.
5.2.3. Quality assessment
Quality assessment tasks are concerned with detecting defects in software requirements specifications. [102, 103]. We recognized 17 papers focusing on tasks related to the following quality
assessment tasks:
• Ambiguity Detection: This task helps in the identification of ambiguous requirements.
The works under this sub-category (9 papers) can be further classified based on the discussed
level of ambiguity:
– Lexical Ambiguity: The main focus at this level is the ambiguity caused by words and
terms. We recognized 6 papers related to this level [93, 104, 105, 106, 10, 107].
– Syntactic Ambiguity: This level focuses on detecting sentences that have different possible grammatical structures. We recognized one paper handling this level of ambiguity
(Osama et al. [108]).
11
– Semantic Ambiguity: This level focuses on detecting confusing contexts in sentences such
as anaphoric ambiguity and coordination ambiguity. We recognized one paper handling
this level (Ezzini et al. [109]).
– Pragmatic Ambiguity: This level focuses on detecting sentences with multiple meanings.
We recognized one paper handling this level (Ferrari et al. [110])
• Incompleteness Detection: This task is concerned with detecting any possible incompleteness in requirements statements. We recognized 3 papers handling this task [111, 112, 113].
• Conformance With Templates: This task focuses on verifying that the requirements are
indeed written according to pre-defined templates. We recognized one work proposing a
solution to handle this task (Arrora et al. [114]); specifically, this work focused on checking
the conformance of requirements with two well-known templates: Rupp [115] and EARS [116]
templates.
• Vagueness Detection: Vagueness occurs when a statement can have a continuum of interpretations (e.g., when using words like tall, large, etc.). We recognized one paper focusing on
this problem (Cruz et al. [117]).
• General Assessment: Other papers suggest approaches providing a general assessment
for different aspects of requirements quality. Three papers can be classified under this type
[118, 102, 103]
5.2.4. Modeling
Modeling software requirements is the process of transferring the natural language requirements
into models and diagrams [119]. We recognized 12 papers proposing solutions related to this type
of RE tasks. One of the main differences between these works is the type of the generated model:
• Use Case Diagrams [120, 121, 119, 122], that focus on actors and their corresponding actions.
• Feature Models [123, 124], that define features and their dependencies.
• Conceptual Diagrams[125, 126], that focus on concepts and relationships between them.
• Glossaries [127, 128], which define technical terms which are specific to an application domain.
• Goal Models [129], that focus on the objectives which a system should achieve through the
cooperation of actors in the intended software and the environment.
• Semantic of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) [130], which defines the semantics of
business vocabulary, business facts, and business rules.
12
5.2.5. Requirements Management
Requirements management is an ongoing activity throughout the development process [131].
We classified two tasks under this category:
• Requirements Prioritization: the main target for this task is to determine which candidate
requirements of a software product should be included in a certain release. We recognized 5
papers handling this task [132, 133, 134, 135, 136].
• Effort Estimation: This task focuses on estimating the effort involved in implementing a
requirement [137]. We found 2 papers proposing methods to handle this problem [138, 137].
Both of them focused on estimating the effort in Agile development methodologies.
5.2.6. Others
One of the retrieved papers (Mishra et al. [139]) focused on building a language model for the
software requirement domain. This model was based on a domain-specific text corpus collected by
crawling the software engineering category on Wikipedia.
5.3. (RQ3) What are the proposed representations in the literature for RE tasks?
In general, almost all covered papers consist of two main phases:
(1) Representation Phase: NLP processing steps are applied to analyze requirements texts, and to
capture linguistic information in order to represent them in various forms.
(2) Solving Phase: the results of the previous stage are used to solve the targeted problem based
on various ML and non-ML approaches.
Fig. 4 shows these two phases and the techniques used for each of them. Overall, we recognized
five different text representation techniques used to handle the first phase: Lexical and syntactic
features, ontology-based representation, VSM, topic modeling-based representation, and advanced
embedding techniques. On the other hand, two families of solutions were proposed for the second
phase: Machine Learning approaches which represent 55% of papers, and Rule-Based approaches
(in 45% of papers) where patterns, regular expressions, and heuristics were used.
To answer our third research question (RQ3), we explore the representations used in the first
phase in more detail:
5.3.1. Lexical and Syntactic features
This part represents the largest group with more than 46% of papers (48 out of the selected
104 papers). The solutions proposed in these papers share a similar pipeline: (1) Applying a set
of NLP pre-processing steps. (2) Representing each requirement as a pre-defined set of linguistic
features. (3) Then, proceeding to the solving phase which uses ML techniques (such as Decision
Trees [97, 138, 81, 118, 52], SVM [53, 10, 88], and RF [96, 60, 90, 49]), or rule-based approach using
a set of syntactic regular expressions [125, 95, 126, 130, 117].

Figure 4: The general flow and the used techniques for each phase
The used pre-defined set of features (in step 2) usually includes features related to the following
four groups:
• The lexical and morphological features, which are based on requirement words and their
morphological information, such as token, stem (or lemma), n-gram (sequence of words).
• The syntactic features, which are derived from the syntax-related information in the requirement statement, such as POS-tag, chunks (noun or verb phrases), dependency relations,
and the entities extracted using NER.
• The frequency-based features, which are based on the requirements list frequency metadata such as the number of words and the number of requirements.
• Dictionary-based features, which are extracted with the help of special dictionaries representing special words lists.
To further investigate the commonly used features, Fig. 5 shows the most frequently used
features and the number of papers that consider each of these features. The most used feature is
the POS-tag, as it is considered in 34 out of the total 48 papers related to this type of representation.

5.3.2. Ontology-Based Representation
This group represents about 9% of papers (9 out of 104). It benefits from pre-defined lexicons
and semantic resources to extend the lexical and syntactic features. Most of these papers used a
rule-based approach in their solutions by applying various ontology-path-based similarity measures.

Figure 6: The used ontologies with their frequencies
One of the main differences between these papers is whether the used ontology is general or
domain-specific. Fig. 6 shows three types of works under this category based on the type of the
used ontology: 6 papers used a general ontology (specifically WordNet) [127, 129, 113, 105, 140, 74],
while 2 papers used a domain-specific ontology [110, 109], and one paper merges both approaches
in its similarity calculations [83].
5.3.3. VSM
Various forms of VSM representation are used in 15% of papers (15 papers). These works
combine the BOW technique with different weighting methods. The most frequent combination is
BOW with TF-IDF (10 papers). Fig 7 shows all used weighting methods with their frequencies.

Figure 7: Weighting methods used in VSM representations with their frequency
Based on this type of representation, each requirement is represented as a vector of words or
tokens or stems combined with their weights. These vectors are used in the subsequent phase to
apply similarity-based rules [55, 71] or as an input to train machine learning models (such as SVM
[87, 69, 40, 141]).
5.3.4. Topic modeling based representations
About 8% of papers (8 papers) used topic modeling techniques to represent requirements texts
based on automatically discovered latent topics. Two main topic modeling techniques are used in
these papers: LSA and LDA. Fig 8 shows the distribution of these two techniques over the related
papers.

The output of both techniques is a k-dimensional space that reflects a k latent topics within
the processed requirements. Then, each requirement is represented as a vector representation in
this k-dimensional space. In most related papers, this representation is employed to calculate the
similarity between requirements as a part of similarity-based rules [70, 107] or clustering machine
learning techniques [135, 99, 78].
5.3.5. Advanced Embedding Representations
This part represents the second largest group of papers (24 papers) with a major increase in
the last couple of years. It is noted that papers that use this kind of representations achieve
promising results in many major tasks such as requirement classification [11, 50, 51], traceability
[64, 56, 59, 58], ambiguity detection [106], and requirement extraction [98, 91].
16
Based on this type of representation, each requirement is represented as a vector of floating
point values. The proposed representations in the related papers are built following two generic
steps (Fig. 9): First, each token in the requirement text is represented using a word embedding
technique; then the final requirement representation is constructed using the representation of its
words. To further investigate papers that use advanced embedding techniques, we explore the
techniques and models used in the implementation of each of these two steps.
• Word Representation: Various word embedding techniques were used in the related literature. Word2vec and BERT are the most common techniques utilized in this group; together
they were used in 17 out of the total 24 papers related to this group. Other works used GloVe
and FastText models, while the remaining papers used an embedding layer instead (added to
the front of their neural network model).
Table 2 shows the related papers for each of the used word embedding techniques.

The aggregation approach is the most used technique (16 out of 24). It produces the requirement representation by applying various aggregation methods on word embedding results such
as:
– Using the average of words embedding to represent statements [101, 128, 66].
– For BERT-based word embedding, a special token ([CLS]) is added to the beginning
of the sentence and is used to calculate an aggregated representation of the statement
[11, 64, 91, 84, 98].

Figure 9: The general flow of representing requirements based on advanced embedding techniques
– Combining the syntactic information with the semantic ones by (1) classifying words
based on their syntactic role, (2) calculating the weighted average for each role, then (3)
concatenating the resultant vectors to form the final representation [58].
– Representing requirements by representing its main ”semantic frames” which can be retrieved with the help of FrameNet [142]. The representation of these frames is calculated
by averaging the embedding vectors of their words [59].
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based representation takes word embedding vectors as input.
It finds a dense and low-dimensional semantic representation for each requirement statement
by sequentially and recurrently processing its words. Many RNN architectures have been
used in the related papers such as LSTM [51, 137, 43], Bi-LSTM [54], BI-GRU [67], and
Skip-Thought [112].
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based representation takes word embedding vectors as
input. It finds the final representation through a number of convolutional layers, pooling
layers, and fully connected layers [39, 50].

5.4. (RQ4) What are the main research directions to represent requirements for each category of
RE tasks?
To answer this question, we start with a general overview of how the research directions to
represent requirements have evolved over the last decade; then we present a deeper analysis of the
trends and possible future directions in each category of RE tasks.
5.4.1. General Overview
Fig. 10 shows the number of papers according to the used NLP representation and the year
of publication. The bubble chart (Fig. 10) shows clearly how the trend has changed in the last
few years from the lexical and syntactic features to the advanced embedding techniques. These
embedding representations became the most used type in the last 2 years (2020-2021) with 15 out
of 40 published works in that period.

5.4.2. Research directions for each category of RE tasks
To further investigate the trends of various representations, we studied their distribution over
the main categories.
Fig. 11 shows the number of papers that used each of these representations for each category.
As noted, representing requirements based on a set of lexical and syntactic features is the most used
approach in many tasks, especially in quality assessment and requirement modeling. However, there
is a clear interest in the use of advanced embedding and VSM-based representations in requirement
analysis tasks.

Figure 11: The percentage of used NLP representation for each category of RE tasks
The following sub-sections discuss the trends for each category.
• Requirement Analysis: Embedding techniques have been proven to be useful for various
requirement analysis tasks [11, 64, 58, 59]. Two recent studies [11, 64] compared the performance of lexical-syntactic features representation with advanced embedding representation,
and concluded that using embedding vectors led to better results in requirement classification
[11] and traceability detection [64] tasks. This finding is consistent with the results observed
in the NLP literature [143], which indicate that embedding techniques are powerful in determining the similarity of words and sentences. of words and sentences. Similarity represents
the core operation in almost all requirements analysis tasks.
• Quality Assessment: More than 50% of quality assessment papers used lexical and syntactic
features to represent requirements (Fig. 11). However, a deeper analysis of related papers
showed that we can differentiate between two types of quality-related RE tasks:
– The majority of papers focused on lexical and syntactic quality-related issues such as
lexical ambiguity and conformance with templates. Many significant contributions provide experiments that indicate the effectiveness of using lexical and syntactic features to
represent requirements when handling this category of tasks [103, 102, 114, 144].
– The remaining papers focused on semantic quality-related issues such as incompleteness,
and semantic-level quality problems. For these tasks, the most used representation in
the literature is ontology-based representation [109, 113, 111]. Besides, one of the recent
interesting works employed advanced embedding representation based on an embedding
layer with a Skip-Thought model to handle incompleteness detection problem [112].
• Requirements Extraction: It is noted that there are two directions to handle requirements
extraction tasks based on the source of data:
– Extracting requirements from documents: the structured format of these documents
20
motivated many researchers to use lexical and syntactic features. All retrieved papers
under this sub-category used lexical and syntactic representations [92, 96, 95].
– Extracting requirements from reviews, forums, or similar applications: Most of the recent papers (especially the ones published in the last 2 years) used advanced embedding
techniques to handle these tasks [84, 91, 101]. This finding could be due to the approaches used to handle this type of requirement extraction tasks; most solutions handle
the problem as a classification task (classify sentences or phrases into requirements or
not requirements classes) or a clustering task (group sentences that mention the same
aspects in the product). Both approaches (clustering and classification) make the embedding technique more suitable (as mentioned previously when discussing the requirement
analysis case).
• Requirements Modeling: Almost all works under this category represent requirements
based on their lexical and syntactic features or using ontology-based representation [130, 120,
129]. These features are used in the form of rules and syntactic patterns to generate various
models based on rule-based transfer techniques.
• Requirements Management: Most of the papers under this category use lexical and syntactic features representation [136, 133, 134]. However, the number of NLP-based publications
related to this category is still limited to have a clear conclusion regarding the suitable representations for this type of tasks.
5.5. (RQ5) What gaps and potential future directions exist in this field?
Our survey shows that the use of NLP-based requirements representation has made remarkable
progress over the last decade. Based on our findings in the previous research questions (especially
RQ4), the use of advanced embedding techniques to represent requirements seems to be promising
for most RE tasks (mainly requirement analysis, extracting requirements from reviews and forums,
and semantic-level quality tasks). Besides, representing requirements based on a set of lexical and
syntactic features or using ontology-based information seems more suitable for other RE tasks (such
as modeling and syntax-level quality tasks).
In the following paragraphs, we will discuss the gaps that represent potential future research
directions in this domain.
5.5.1. More RE domain-specific word embedding models
As shown in Fig. 9, word representation plays an essential role in representing requirements
(mainly when using embedding techniques). To implement this step, most researchers use generic
word embedding pre-trained models in their solutions. One of the main limitations of these generic
models is their inability to provide appropriate representations for many domain-specific words.
21
For example, the domain-specific meaning of words like ”virus”, ”cookies”, ”Python”, ”fork”, etc.
can not be captured based on models trained on generic corpora [139]. Building such domainspecific word embedding models is notoriously a challenging task, especially with the little size of
data available in the RE domain. One of the recent works [139] provided an embedding model
trained on 92 MB of texts collected from Wikipedia pages related to the software engineering
domain. However, more research is needed (1) to have embedding models trained on more practical
industrial texts, (2) and to evaluate the use of these models in various RE tasks.
5.5.2. More suitable statements representation techniques
Another important challenge, related to embedding techniques, is the way of merging word vectors to formulate requirements representations (step 2 in Fig 9). Although the suggested techniques
lead to good accuracy in some RE tasks (such as requirements classification and traceability detection), these representations can still be considered as a step towards more suitable representations.
Most of these works use aggregation techniques (that ignore word order [145]) or RNN-based technique (that usually focus on predicting the next element in a sequence [146]). These works can be
further improved by considering more RE domain-specific representations [58]. One of the main
potential future directions to handle this problem is using a ”syntax-aware sentence embedding”
technique that considers both the main syntactic roles in requirement statements (such as actor,
action, objects,...) and the semantic aspects of requirements.
5.5.3. More adaptive syntactic processing
Many studies have concluded that there is a gap between RE tasks automation research and
its implementation undertaken in industrial and real-life projects [147, 148, 149]. This gap is more
obvious in the case of rule-based approaches since they usually need the requirements to be represented based on specific templates [150]; hence, their success strongly depends on the consistency of
the requirements with the predefined templates [114, 150]. Using such “template-based” approaches
to handle RE tasks could lead to lower accuracy when applied to new requirements written based on
some variations of the predefined template or a completely different template. These situations are
common in real-life projects when it is hard to control requirements authoring environments, especially in large development projects, or when one has little control over the requirements authoring
environments. [114, 151, 147, 148, 149, 150, 12]. One of the potential future research directions
is working on more adaptive approaches which can be more flexible when handling requirements,
such as identifying the syntactic structures automatically and building more adaptive approaches
based on the dynamically identified structure.
5.5.4. More research in some RE tasks
Only a few works handled the following RE tasks: requirements prioritization, effort estimation,
and semantic and pragmatic level quality tasks. More research should be conducted to explore the
efficiency of using advanced embedding techniques for these tasks.
22
6. Main Findings:
In this section, we summarize the main conclusions and findings in the following points:
(1) There is a significant increase in the number of papers that use NLP-based requirements representation over the last decade. The increase is more obvious in the last 2 years.
(2) We recognized 104 papers that employed an NLP-based representation to solve various RE
tasks. We classified these works based on (1) the targeted RE task using a hierarchy consisting
of 6 top-level categories and 19 sub-categories (Fig. 3), (2) the used NLP-based representation
using 5 classes of text representation techniques (Fig. 4).
(3) Using advanced embedding techniques to represent requirements seems to be promising for most
RE tasks (especially requirement analysis, extracting requirements from reviews and forums,
semantic-level quality tasks). Besides, representing requirements based on a set of lexical and
syntactic features or using ontology-based information seems more suitable for other RE tasks
(such as modeling and syntax-level quality tasks).
(4) Most of the proposed embedding-based representations use generic language models that suffer
from limitations when representing the meaning of software engineering terms. Having more
domain-specific language models to represent words is considered one of the important research
directions in future works.
(5) Most of the proposed embedding-based techniques represent requirements statements without
giving attention to the special structure of a software requirement that consists of clear components (actor, action, data object, etc). Using syntax-aware statements embedding could be one
of the possible solutions to have more domain-specific representations that reflect the semantics
of requirements in a better way (compared to traditional aggregation approaches).
(6) There is a need for more flexible approaches in terms of the ability to handle requirements that
do not follow (completely or partially) standard requirements templates, which is the common
case in real-life projects.
(7) The number of researches that use NLP-based representation is still limited for some RE tasks
(requirements prioritization, effort estimation, semantic-based quality assessment).
Finally, tables 4 and 5 summarize the extracted information for all 104 selected papers, in
addition to their categorization based on their targeted RE task and the used text representation.
In the matrix represented in Table 4, each cell includes the papers related to each category of RE
tasks and text representation. Note that two papers ([97] and [98]) are mentioned twice in the table
since they are related to both requirement analysis and requirement extraction categories. Table
5 shows a detailed summary of the 104 papers. This table includes detailed information about
the input and the output of the approach proposed in each paper. In addition, it encloses other
descriptive information including the employed text processing steps, details about the solution
technique (e.g., which ML approach is used), the used dataset, and a summary of the results.

This table provides a starting point for researchers and practitioners in this field to obtain a quick
overview of the state-of-the-art in each RE task, including the recommended dataset to be used
and the most related publications.
7. Threats To Validity
Likewise any secondary research process, it is almost impossible to guarantee that we found the
entire population of all the relevant papers. However, several actions were undertaken to minimize
threats to validity.
• To ensure the inclusion of almost all relevant academic works in the field, we followed a
systematic mapping review methodology based on the recommenced guidelines for similar
cases.[15].
• Five reputable and well-known data sources ( Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library,
ScienceDirect, and SpringerLink) were chosen to maximize the number of candidate papers.
• We tried to make our search string as general as possible by including various synonyms for
each term and by including papers that cover either syntactic or semantic aspects. However,
24
the final search string may not encompass all the existing synonyms, which might lead to not
capturing all the relevant studies. We mitigated this threat by checking the references of the
final selected papers to add any additional relevant works.
• To minimize mistakes caused by subjective analyses, we followed a rigorous study selection
process, guided by clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. However, the exclusion of papers
published in languages other than English may have failed to potentially find some relevant
works.
• When there were doubts or conflicts about whether to include an article or not, the final
decision is discussed between authors.
• To obtain data consistency and avoid bias in data extraction, we defined a clear data extraction
template and discussed our results in several brainstorming sessions.
8. Conclusion
This study presents a systematic mapping review of the used NLP-based representations in
various RE tasks. Starting from 2,227 papers retrieved from five well-known digital libraries, we
recognized 104 primary papers fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria. We analyzed these
works and categorized them based on: the targeted RE task and the used text representation.
Our results indicate that about two-thirds of retrieved publications handle tasks related to
requirements classification, requirements traceability, ambiguity detection, and extracting requirements from reviews and documents. On the other hand, Lexical and syntactic features are widely
used to represent requirements (more than 45% of publications). Besides, a growing number of
papers use advanced word embedding techniques, especially in the last two years. Moreover, we
summarize the main research directions to represent requirements in each category, and identify
the gaps and possible future directions.
The data extracted from the selected 104 papers and their categorization, can help as a useful
set of references for further analysis in each task or category of tasks in RE. Besides, trends and
gaps identified from this mapping study have provided many new ideas for research opportunities.
