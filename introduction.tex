\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

This review explores how large language models (LLMs) are transforming linguistic steganography, the practice of hiding messages in text. We focus on the unique challenges and advances in using LLMs for secure, imperceptible, and high-capacity covert communication.

\subsection{Overview of Information Security and Concealment Systems}
Information security systems include \textbf{encryption}, \textbf{privacy}, and \textbf{concealment} (steganography).

\subsubsection{Encryption Systems and Privacy Systems}
These protect content but reveal that secret communication is happening, which can attract attention.

\subsubsection{Concealment Systems (Steganography)}
Steganography hides the existence of information by embedding it in ordinary carriers (e.g., text, images). Text is a challenging carrier due to its low redundancy and strict semantics.

\subsection{Introduction to Steganography}
Steganography is often explained by the ``Prisoners' Problem,'' where Alice and Bob must communicate secretly under surveillance. The goal is to embed messages so they are undetectable to an observer.

Steganography methods include \textbf{carrier selection}, \textbf{carrier modification}, and \textbf{carrier generation}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Carrier modification:} Hide information in existing text with minimal changes.
    \item \textbf{Carrier generation:} Generate new text that encodes information, allowing higher capacity but requiring naturalness.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Significance of Linguistic Steganography}
Linguistic steganography enables covert communication, especially where encryption is suspicious. Text is a robust, ubiquitous carrier but presents challenges in balancing imperceptibility and capacity. Advances in deep learning and LLMs improve text quality and security, while related fields like watermarking focus on tracing content origin.



\subsection{Scope of the Review}
This review covers LLM-based linguistic steganography, focusing on methods, evaluation, challenges, and future directions.
